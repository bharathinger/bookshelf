## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `14 || 16 || 18`
- [npm][npm] v8.16.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].


After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/bookshelf.git
cd bookshelf
node setup
```

This may take a few minutes.

If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what
the problem is. If you can't work it out on your own then please [file an
issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the commands you ran (even if
it's a lot).

If you can't get the setup script to work, then just make sure you have the
right versions of the requirements listed above, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run validate
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it. The tests are there to help you reach the final version,
however _sometimes_ you can accomplish the task and the tests still fail if you
implement things differently than I do in my solution, so don't look to them as
a complete authority.
